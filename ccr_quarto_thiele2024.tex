\abstract{Citizen-generated populism is flourishing in the comments

populist communication from below are still under-researched. This study
focuses on the COVID-19 crisis to examine how contextual and
media-related factors are related to the extent of populism in comment
sections on Facebook pages of news outlets from seven European countries
(AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, SE and UK). Computational text analysis, machine
translation and Bayesian multilevel regression were used to analyze
digital trace data from 65,258 posts and 3.4 million comments published
between February 2020 and June 2021. The computational measurements -
multilingual dictionaries for posts and distributed dictionary
representation to capture populism in comments - were rigorously
validated. The results show that posts referring to the government,
experts, COVID-19, and restrictions exhibit higher levels of populism in
the comments sections. The stringency of containment policies was
positively associated with populism in Germany, Austria, and the
Netherlands when COVID-19 was mentioned. Lower levels of populism were
observed for tabloid media and when news outlets engaged in visible
moderation. The implications of these findings beyond the pandemic
context and methodological challenges are discussed.}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Populist messages travel well on social media (Ernst et al. 2019;
Gerbaudo 2018). Politicians employ populist communication to stimulate
user interactions (Jost, Maurer, and Hassler 2020). The participatory
logic of social media also allows ordinary citizens to express their
populist views (de Vreese et al. 2018). Comments sections below news are
bursting with citizen-generated populism, whether on websites (Blassnig,
Engesser, et al. 2019) or on Facebook pages operated by news media
(Thiele 2022a). In parallel to a growing interest in populist attitudes
(Marcos-Marne, Gil de Zúñiga, and Borah 2023), researchers have begun to
investigate populism in user comments (e.g., Blassnig, Engesser, et al.
2019; Galpin and Trenz 2019). These studies have focused on election
periods (Blassnig, Engesser, et al. 2019; Galpin and Trenz 2019) or
relied on narrow country selections (Thiele 2022a). What is lacking are
cross-national studies that provide a comprehensive understanding of how
``populism in reader comments is influenced by characteristics of the
article or other context factors'' (Blassnig, Ernst, et al. 2019, 1124).
This study narrows this research gap by examining populism in user
comments (henceforth ``comments'') on news media Facebook pages from
seven European countries -- Austria, France, Germany, Italy,
Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom -- in the context of
COVID-19.

COVID-19 provides a unique opportunity for studying contextual
influences on citizen-generated populism. Government containment
policies drastically restricted personal freedoms, triggering
psychological reactance in some citizens (Dillard et al. 2023). In many
European countries, containment policies were met with protests (Kriesi
and Oana 2023; Neumayer, Pfaff, and Plümper 2023) that resonated with
populist ideology (Brubaker 2021; Stecula and Pickup 2021). Expressing
discontent online became increasingly important during lockdowns (Kriesi
and Oana 2023). Online, COVID-19 was accompanied by an ``infodemic'',
which is particularly well researched with regard to the spread of
conspiracy theories (Righetti, Rossi, and Marino 2022). Less is known
about the crisis's impact on the proliferation of populist content in
comments sections, which is unfortunate as comments can, for instance,
influence other readers' attitudes toward vaccinations (Sun and Lu
2023). Previously, I found that populist comments in Germany and Austria
are linked to media coverage of COVID-19 (Thiele 2022a). The limited
country selection of that study prevented an adequate investigation of
the impact of containment policies and additional media-related factors.
Addressing these shortcomings, the present study aims to answer the
following research question: How did the COVID-19 crisis and
media-related factors influence populism in user comments on news media
Facebook pages in seven Western European countries?

Here, seven hypotheses and three research questions are examined using
digital trace data. This data source warrants high external validity
(Blassnig, Engesser, et al. 2019, 630) but does not allow the direct
testing of psychological mechanisms. Therefore, the analysis focuses on
the contextual correlates of populism in user comments. A total of
65,258 posts and 3.4 million comments posted during the first three
waves of COVID-19 (February 2020 -- June 2021) on 21 news media Facebook
pages from seven European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, SE, UK) was
analyzed. Comments were machine-translated (Vries, Schoonvelde, and
Schumacher 2018) into German. To measure populism, a computational text
analysis technique called ``distributed dictionary representation''
(Garten et al. 2018) was implemented (Thiele 2022b), applied, and
validated. Post characteristics were captured using validated
multilingual dictionaries. Real-world data were obtained from the Oxford
COVID-19 government response tracker (OxCGRT) (Hale et al. 2020).
Hypotheses were tested using Bayesian multilevel linear regression
models (Bürkner et al. 2022).

The results show that Facebook posts mentioning the government, experts,
COVID-19, and restrictions were associated with higher levels of
populism in comments. The stringency of COVID-19 policies affected
populism differently in the analyzed countries. I found a limited,
positive association in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands when posts
mentioned COVID-19. Moderating comments by the media and, surprisingly,
the media-type tabloid press were associated with lower levels of
populism. The study concludes by discussing the implications of the
findings beyond the pandemic and methodological limitations.

\subsubsection{Populism in User
Comments}\label{populism-in-user-comments}}

Social media has changed the logic of political communication,
integrating ordinary citizens into producing and distributing the news
(Klinger and Svensson 2015). Most news media outlets operate pages on
social media, where they share links to articles on their websites.
Facebook remains the most widely used social media platform for news
consumption in all countries studied here, although its heyday has
passed (Newman et al. 2022). On Facebook, users can comment under posts
to express their opinions and engage in discussions and deliberation
(Dahlberg 2011) or for less constructive purposes (Quandt 2018).
Negative aspects, such as high levels of incivility, often prevail in
these spaces (Coe, Kenski, and Rains 2014). Populist content is one of
those negative aspects (Waisbord 2018) and can have detrimental
implications for the quality of the user discussion (Thiele and Turnšek
2022).

Following Mudde (2004, 543), populism is a thin-centered ideology which
holds that `the people' are ruled by a `corrupt elite' and which demands
unrestricted popular sovereignty. Populists imagine the people as a
``homogenous and virtuous community'' (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser
2018, 3) that is only divided and deprived of its sovereignty at the
instigation of a treacherous elite (Mudde 2004). The concept entails at
least two dimensions: \emph{anti-elitism} and \emph{people-centrism}
(Rooduijn 2019). Popular sovereignty, which is sometimes considered a
third dimension, is here considered as the point of contention between
the people and the elite (Aslanidis 2018, 1255). Following a
communication-centered approach, I focus on expressions of populist
ideas in text (de Vreese et al. 2018). Online, populist ideology is
often communicated in fragments (Engesser et al. 2017). Messages can be
therefore more or less populist on a continuous scale (Aslanidis 2018).
Different actors can disseminate populist messages. Populism from
politicians (Ernst et al. 2019) and journalists (Wettstein et al. 2019)
has received most scholarly attention. Although populism revolves around
the idea of making the people's voice heard (Canovan 1999), only a
handful of studies have focused on populist content disseminated by
ordinary citizens (Blassnig, Engesser, et al. 2019; Blassnig, Ernst, et
al. 2019; Galpin and Trenz 2019; Thiele 2022a; Thiele and Turnšek 2022).
These studies have mostly analyzed comments on news websites (Blassnig,
Engesser, et al. 2019; Galpin and Trenz 2019). Here, I focus on comments
below news media posts on Facebook, which is a preferred social media
platform among populists (Schulz 2019). Facebook comments also exhibit a
particularly low deliberative quality (Esau, Friess, and Eilders 2017).

To explain the occurrence of populist comments, Blassnig et al. (2019,
634) have suggested to consider them as expressions of populist
attitudes. Following Hawkins et al. (2020), populist attitudes require
activation through the political context. Krämer (2014, 55) argued that
messages, such as media coverage, can activate a cognitive ``populism
schema'' through priming. Hameleers et al. (2021) showed that fragments
of populist communication can activate larger clusters of populist
attitudes. Here, I argue that mentioning representatives of the elite in
media posts works as an activating cue that eventually triggers populist
comments. The elite is the key antagonist for populists (Hameleers et
al. 2021). Governments and experts are frequent targets of populist
rhetoric (Jagers and Walgrave 2007; Mede and Schäfer 2020) and were
omnipresent in media coverage as managers of the COVID-19 crisis
(Brubaker 2021). Mentioning these groups may activate populist attitudes
and motivate populist citizens to express these views, possibly by an
emotional mechanism (Rico, Guinjoan, and Anduiza 2017). Previous
findings support this argument (Thiele 2022a). Therefore, I hypothesize
the following:

\textbf{H1:} Facebook posts from news media mentioning the government
are associated with increased levels of populism in the comments
section.

\textbf{H2:} Facebook posts from news media mentioning experts are
associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

Second, newsrooms' practices in moderating comments might affect opinion
expression (Gibson 2019). Some moderation practices are visible to other
users, for example, when news media pages comment below their own posts
to remind users about conversational rules (Wintterlin et al. 2020).
Populist users, known for breaching such norms (Hameleers 2019), may
react to such moderation by turning silent, as they sense a hostile
opinion climate (Matthes, Knoll, and von Sikorski 2018). Conversely,
moderation might also backfire if it is perceived as censorship
(Sherrick and Hoewe 2018). Against this backdrop, I pose the following
open research question regarding comments authored by the news media
pages themselves:

\textbf{RQ1:} How are comments from news media moderating discussions on
Facebook associated with the level of populism in comments sections?

Third, the level of populism in comments sections may vary across the
type of news media operating the Facebook page. Theorists have often
claimed complicity between the tabloid press and populism (Krämer 2014;
Mazzoleni 2008), but content analyses have struggled to corroborate this
claim (e.g., Bos and Brants 2014). Readers of tabloid newspapers,
however, support populist attitudes more strongly than audiences of
public television or quality press (Schulz 2019). The implications of
these findings for populism in comments remain unclear. Hence, I pose a
second open research question:

\textbf{RQ2:} How is the type of news media operating a Facebook page
associated with the level of populism in comments sections?

\hypertarget{the-pandemic-and-populism}{%
\subsubsection{The Pandemic and
Populism}\label{the-pandemic-and-populism}}

One main objective of this study is to examine how the context of
COVID-19 has affected populism in comments. COVID-19 yielded a range of
political consequences. While the first wave saw increased support for
governments (Schraff 2021), later stages were characterized by growing
polarization and protests against containment policies (Kriesi and Oana
2023; Neumayer, Pfaff, and Plümper 2023). Scholars have linked those
protests to populist ideology (Brubaker 2021; Flew 2021; Stecula and
Pickup 2021). Both, protesters against COVID-19 containment policies and
populists exhibit a fundamental distrust in elites, an appetite for
conspiracy theories, and a preference for commonsensical over expert
knowledge (Brubaker 2021; Stecula and Pickup 2021). Populist parties in
Europe did not respond uniformly to the outbreak of the pandemic
(Wondreys and Mudde 2022) but tried to later capitalize on the protests.
Previous research has explained these protest events by strategic
considerations of the organizers (Neumayer, Pfaff, and Plümper 2023).
This explanation is convincing for offline events but offers little to
explain expressions of discontent online, where little collective
organization is required. The argument proposed here instead draws on a
psychological mechanism.

\emph{Psychological reactance} (J. W. Brehm 1966; S. S. Brehm and Brehm
1981) provides a conceptual framework to link the COVID-19 crisis and
expressions of populism\emph{.} Reactance ``is the motivational state
that is hypothesized to occur when a freedom is eliminated or
threatened'' (S. S. Brehm and Brehm 1981, 37). It involves anger and
negative cognitions motivating people to restore the threatened freedom
or, if this option is blocked, to engage in aggressive or compensatory
behavior (Dillard and Shen 2005; Rosenberg and Siegel 2018). Cumulative
evidence shows that the severity of a restriction tends to increase
reactance (Rosenberg and Siegel 2018, 3). While individuals react
differently to experiencing reactance, commonly observed responses are
expressing hostility toward, and derogating the source of, the
restriction (Rosenberg and Siegel 2018, 3). COVID-19 containment
policies triggered such reactance reactions in some individuals (Dillard
et al. 2023).

I argue that experiencing reactance can activate populist attitudes
(Hawkins, Rovira Kaltwasser, and Andreadis 2020) because of the anger
involved in it (Dillard and Shen 2005). Anger has been linked to the
support of populist ideas (Rico, Guinjoan, and Anduiza 2017), and
experiencing reactance during COVID-19 is associated with
anti-government attitudes (Hajek and Häfner 2021). Moreover, populist
expressions by opponents of containment policies reflect what reactance
researchers call derogating the source of the restriction (Rosenberg and
Siegel 2018). For example, the government, scientists, and the media are
denounced for having fabricated the crisis to impose a dictatorship
(Brubaker 2021). While examining individual motivations for such
statements is beyond the scope of this study, the theoretical framework
sketched here is useful for deriving hypotheses regarding the impact of
contextual (Hawkins, Rovira Kaltwasser, and Andreadis 2020) and
content-based (Krämer 2014) factors on populism in comments.

First, reactance occurs more frequently when people believe they are
being targeted by persuasion (Rosenberg and Siegel 2018). Media coverage
of COVID-19 arguably included fear appeals (Sun and Lu 2023; Thiele
2022a) that is ``persuasive messages designed to scare people by
describing the terrible things that will happen to them if they do not
do what the message recommends'' (Witte 1992, 329). Opponents of
COVID-19 policies often suspect COVID-19 coverage to be propaganda (Flew
2021). Those citizens believe themselves to be targeted by a persuasion
campaign. Such beliefs should spark reactance and could motivate
citizens to express their anger in comments. Previous findings linked
COVID-19 coverage in Germany and Austria to populist comments (Thiele
2022a). News posts that explicitly mention restrictive COVID-19 policies
may provoke even stronger reactions, as they prime freedom-threatening
aspects. Following these considerations, I hypothesize the following:

\textbf{H3}: Facebook posts from news media mentioning COVID-19 are
associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

\textbf{H4}: Facebook posts from news media mentioning restrictive
COVID-19 containment policies are associated with increased levels of
populism in the comments section.

Second, the magnitude of the threat to personal freedoms has been
repeatedly found to be positively related to the level of reactance
(Organ 1974; Rosenberg and Siegel 2018). In the context of COVID-19, the
magnitude of restrictions can be determined as the ``stringency'' of
COVID-19 containment policies, which included lockdowns, closing public
venues, travel restrictions, or obligations to wear masks. To be clear,
stringency denotes the severity of COVID-19 containment policies varying
by day and country (Hale et al. 2020), \emph{not} the logical
consistency of policies. Additionally, I expect that the stringency of
COVID-19 policies affects populism in comments sections only if the news
post mentions the topic of COVID-19. Therefore, I hypothesize:

\textbf{H5}: For Facebook posts from news media mentioning COVID-19, the
stringency of COVID-19 containment policies is associated with increased
levels of populism in the comments section.

Third, the \emph{stringency} of containment policies varied considerably
in the countries studied here (Gordon, Grafton, and Steinshamn 2021).
Italy, for example, was hit early and hard by the pandemic and imposed
tough restrictions, while Sweden followed a laissez-faire approach. The
restrictions in Germany and France were comparable but the protests
differed widely (Kriesi and Oana 2023). How these patterns translate to
populist expressions online remains unclear. Hence, I pose the
explorative research question:

\textbf{RQ3:} How does the association between stringency of COVID-19
containment policies and the level of populism in comments sections vary
by country?

Finally, drawing on previous findings (Jørgensen et al. 2022, 1), I
expect that a ``pandemic fatigue'' increased levels of political
discontent and expressions of populist attitudes over time. One reason
could be that repeating persuasive messages can increase reactance (Koch
and Zerback 2013). Similarly, message novelty has been linked to less
reactance (Rosenberg and Siegel 2018). The former implies an effect that
gradually increases over time, while the latter suggests considerably
lower levels of populism during the first wave of COVID-19. Similar
associations were observed previously (Thiele 2022a). As a result, I
hypothesize the following:

\textbf{H6}: Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the level of populism in
comments sections increased.

\textbf{H7}: During the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, the level of
populism in comments sections was lower, compared to later stages.

\subsubsection{Data}\label{data}}

This study analyzes digital trace data, downloaded via Facebook API
using Facepager (Jünger and Keyling 2020) and R. These data warrant high
external validity, as they trace behavior that is likely to be
suppressed in experiments due to social desirability (Blassnig,
Engesser, et al. 2019, 630). Anonymization through the API, however,
limits individual-level analysis. Hence, this study analyzes the
correlates of populism in comments but cannot test psychological or
causal mechanisms directly.

The country selection aimed at maximizing variance in the stringency of
containment policies and the scope of protests (Neumayer, Pfaff, and
Plümper 2023). Seven European countries were selected: Austria (AT),
Germany (DE), France (FR), Italy (IT), Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE),
and United Kingdom (UK). These countries varied considerably regarding
the stringency of COVID-19 containment policies and the level of
protests against them (Neumayer, Pfaff, and Plümper 2023).

These countries also represent different (legacy) media systems (Hallin
and Mancini 2004). What all seven countries have in common is that they
are liberal, Western European democracies that have a record of
successful mobilization by populist parties, mostly from the right
(Mudde 2007). Per country, I selected one news media outlet for each of
the three media types quality press, tabloid press, and public
broadcaster, based on the weekly reach of the corresponding news website
(Newman et al. 2022). For each outlet, I identified the corresponding
Facebook page. Data were only collected from Facebook. Table 1 reports
the selected outlets by country and media type, along with the number of
Facebook followers, and the number of posts considered in the analysis.

From each Facebook page, all accessible posts published in the first
three waves of COVID-19 (1 February 2020 -- 30 June 2021) were
downloaded. For each of the n=65,258 posts, the first 100 comments were
downloaded, resulting in a dataset of n=3,424,691 comments. Capping the
number of comments aimed to limit the number of API calls, as the access
is shared with all Facepager users (Jünger and Keyling 2020). The cap is
ten times larger than in previous studies (Blassnig, Engesser, et al.
2019, 636), and higher than the median number of comments per post
(n=58).

\hypertarget{validation-data}{%
\subsubsection{Validation Data}\label{validation-data}}

For validation, 2,040 posts and 2,040 comments were randomly sampled
with equal distribution across countries for annotation by six
native-speaking, trained coders (five students and the author); 150
units each were machine-translated for parallel coding. Reliability is
reported as Krippendorff's alpha. Occurrences of \emph{anti-elitism}
(alpha=.80) and \emph{people-centrism} (.73) were coded binarily in
comments. Considering the fragmentary nature of populist online
communication (Engesser et al. 2017), a comment was considered populist
if either people-centrism or anti-elitism was coded. Posts were coded
for references to \emph{COVID-19} (.96), \emph{restrictive containment
policies} (.75), the \emph{government} (.78), and scientific
\emph{experts} (.76). The instructions align with Blassnig, Engesser, et
al. (2019; see also Blassnig, Engesser, and Esser 2016) and a previously
used codebook (Thiele 2022a) and are documented in Appendix A.

\hypertarget{multilingual-data}{%
\subsubsection{Multilingual Data}\label{multilingual-data}}

Computational analyses of multilingual texts face the challenge of
ensuring measurement equivalence and context-sensitivity across
countries, while maintaining cost-efficiency (Licht and Lind 2023).
Formal criteria for the first two aspects have yet to be established
(Licht and Lind 2023). Here, several strategies were used to approach
these goals. Relying on native speakers to annotate the validation data
was a first step. The further procedure differed for posts and comments.

Multilingual dictionaries were used to capture topics and actors
mentioned in posts. Dictionaries count the occurrence of keywords.
Pretests suggested that high levels of recall\emph{,} indicating
performance in capturing all relevant documents, and precision,
indicating performance in capturing only relevant documents, could be
achieved by translating an existing German dictionary (Thiele 2022a).
This was the most cost-effective solution. The dictionary was translated
using in-context translation websites (context.reverso.net; linguee.de).
The country-specific dictionaries were expanded by nearest neighbors
from word embeddings (\emph{fastText}) (Bojanowski et al. 2017), trained
on post data. Word embeddings represent semantic relations of words in a
vector space and result from machine learning algorithms, trained on
large corpora (e.g., Bojanowski et al. 2017). With the help of the
mentioned translation websites, I identified and removed terms that
tapped into unintended contexts. Validation is reported in the section
on explanatory variables.

For capturing populism in comments, translating an existing German
dictionary (Gründl 2022) was deemed not feasible, as it contains 13k
regular expressions. To find a ``common denominator'' for comparison,
comments were machine-translated (Licht and Lind 2023, 9). Following
findings of Vries et al. (2018), I opted for the Google Translate API.
German was chosen as the lingua franca, as this limited the costs most
efficiently and matched my expertise in capturing populism in German
text (Thiele and Turnšek 2022). For economic reasons, comments were
truncated to 540 characters before translation, which affected 1.8\% of
all comments.

Two further measures aimed at facilitating context-sensitivity and
equivalence. First, the translated corpus was used to train a custom
word embedding model, which underpins the populism measurement described
below. This model thus provides a common reference point, but also
accounts for country-specific uses of words that may persist even after
translation (Licht and Lind 2023, 23). Second, during optimization, I
selected the measurement that most coherently maximized the
output-validity score across countries. Despite these precautions, the
achieved level of equivalence is not perfect, as discussed in the next
and the concluding section.

\hypertarget{dependent-variable}{%
\subsubsection{Dependent Variable}\label{dependent-variable}}

Populism in comments was measured using the computational text analysis
technique ``distributed dictionary representation'' (DDR) (Garten et al.
2018). DDR combines dictionaries with word embeddings to measure how
strongly a concept is represented in a text (Garten et al. 2018).
Conventional dictionary approaches suffer from low recall (Rauh 2018).
DDR is similarly theory-driven as a dictionary, since it captures a
concept by researcher-defined keywords. However, it circumvents the need
to provide exhaustive lists of words by leveraging word embeddings. The
conceptual dictionary and each document are represented as average
vectors of the embeddings that represent the meaning of each word in
them. DDR then computes the cosine similarity between these vectors,
which can range from -1 to +1. This provides a crude indicator for how
strongly the concept is reflected in each document (Garten et al. 2018).
This technique works best with short, clear-cut dictionaries (Garten et
al. 2018, 348). The \emph{dictvectoR} (Thiele 2022b) R-package
implements DDR using \emph{fastText} word embeddings, which are tailored
to social media texts, and account for misspellings, out-of-vocabulary
words, and morphological rich languages, like German (Bojanowski et al.
2017). A custom \emph{fastText} model was trained on the translated and
originally German corpus of comments, and all German-speaking posts. The
model has 200 dimensions and a vocabulary of 89k words.

The populism measurement was optimized using 70\% of the annotated
comments, keeping 30\% as test sample. For evaluation, DDR scores were
transformed into binary predictors using logistic regression and
compared to the annotation. This is not a gold standard test but
circumvents the problem of producing granular manual annotations
reliably (Grimmer and Stewart 2013, 275). Evaluation focused on F1, a
harmonic mean of recall and precision. The optimization aimed to arrive
at a short, expressive dictionary that is \emph{inductive}
(i.e.~reflects the content of observed comments), \emph{theory-driven}
(i.e.~covers key dimensions of populism), and \emph{comparable}
(i.e.~maximizes F1 consistently across all countries). The process,
documented in Appendix C, followed the following steps: (a) identifying
words from the \emph{fastText} model's vocabulary that semantically
resemble the corpus annotated as populist; (b) adding
multiword-expressions; (c) manually selecting words on theoretical
grounds; (d) generating 2.9 million keyword combinations of different
lengths from these words; and (e) evaluating these dictionaries across
countries.

The dictionary that maximized F1 best across all countries is presented
in Table 1, along with translation and performance scores for the test
and train data. This dictionary was deemed theoretically convincing as
it features words that represent ``the elite'' from different areas of
society (\emph{``politics and media'', ``government'', ``nepotism'',}
\emph{``so-called experts'',} and \emph{``state media''}), words that
invoke ``the people'' as an in-group (``\emph{people'', ''taxpayers'',
''our system'',} and \emph{''our tax money''}), and words that
characterize the struggle over sovereignty between these antagonists
(''\emph{dictatorship'', ``muzzled'',} and \emph{``obfuscate''}).
Although these words are not necessarily populist in isolation, their
combined meaning cuts through a broad range of populist key messages
(Blassnig, Engesser, et al. 2019, 638). This short dictionary is
sensitive to the context of COVID-19 but should be able to capture
populism in other contexts as well.

The DDR measurement performs well overall (F1=.74) and is relatively
consistent across countries. It outperforms Gründl's (2022) dictionary,
which reached a low F1 of .19. Against this backdrop, I consider this
measurement a satisfactory proxy for populism. However, the
output-validity scores vary across countries, with the lowest
test-performance for the Netherlands (F1=.66), indicating a lack of
equivalence and measurement error differential to language. I account
for this by centering the populism scores on the country-level means. In
the concluding section I discuss the limitations of this approach.

The DDR measure was applied to the dataset of translated comments.
Titles of hyperlinks were used when comments contained no other text.
Text cleaning is documented in Appendix B. I replaced n=19,047 missing
values (0.6\%) by the mean populism score per page and week to not lose
observations. The comment-level scores were aggregated per post as mean,
reflecting the manifestation of a collective populist voice (Galpin and
Trenz 2019), standardized, and centered to country-mean.

A German dictionary (Thiele 2022a) was translated and expanded for all
countries to capture mentions of \emph{COVID-19, restrictive policies},
the \emph{government}, and \emph{experts} in posts, as documented in the
section on multilingualism. The case-sensitive government dictionaries
were expanded by the names of the national government members, scraped
from Wikipedia. Validity was tested against the full annotated sample of
n=2,036 posts. Table 3 reports the results. Appendix D documents the

\emph{Moderation} was operationalized as a binary variable, indicating
if a post's comments section included a comment from the news media
account operating the Facebook page, which was not anonymized by the
API. \emph{Media type} is indicated by a categorical variable.

For the \emph{stringency} of COVID-19 policies, this study uses the
index from the \emph{Oxford COVID Response Tracker (OxCRT)} (Hale et al.
2020), which is provided in country-day format. The index is composed of
nine ordinal indicators and ranges from 0 to 100, indicating restrictive
policies by larger values.

\caption{COVID-19 Incidences and Policy Stringency Over Time by Country}

\end{figure}

In Figure 1, the stringency level for each country throughout the
observed time frame is plotted as a colored histogram and the 7-day
incidence rate as a line. The red bars mark phases when containment
policies were stricter than the overall median, the yellow bars indicate
below-median phases. Expecting that policies affect comments with some
delay, this study lagged the stringency variable by 14 days. The lag was
chosen based on its somewhat stronger correlation with populism (.07),
compared to other lags. Time was operationalized by a variable counting
the days since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on
March 11, 2020, and by a dummy indicating if the post was published
during the \emph{first wave} of COVID-19.

\hypertarget{control-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Control Variables}\label{control-variables}}

Controls include the 14-day lagged \emph{incidence rate} (i.e., the
weekly rolling number of new infections per 100.000 inhabitants in a
country-day format, retrieved from the OxCRT). Additional controls are
the number of \emph{comments} per post, \emph{download age} (i.e., days
passed between post and download), and the logged number of Facebook
\emph{fans}. Table 4 presents the summary statistics. Continuous
independent variables were standardized and centered on the population
mean before being included in the models.

\hypertarget{model-specifications}{%
\subsubsection{Model Specifications}\label{model-specifications}}

Linear regression was used for hypothesis testing, as the dependent
variable is continuous. Accounting for the nested structure of the data,
with posts nested in pages, and pages nested in countries, multilevel
models were fitted (Gelman and Hill 2007). The small number of
country-level clusters and the non-randomness of the sample create
problems for frequentist inference (Chan and Rauchfleisch 2023).

Accounting for both, the models were fitted in a Bayesian framework,
using the \emph{brms} package (Bürkner et al. 2022). Media type could be
considered an additional level but was included as a fixed effect, as it
has only three categories. Model 1 accounts for random intercepts for
countries and pages. Model 2 drops four variables to avoid
over-parameterization and adds two interaction terms. Model 3 fits
random slopes for COVID-19, stringency, and their interaction across all
countries. The models were fitted using non-informative priors, and
3,000 iterations of three chains that converged.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

Table 5 reports the results from the linear multilevel Bayesian
regression models with the mean populism score per post as the dependent
variable. H1 proposed that posts mentioning the \emph{government} are
associated with higher levels of populism in the comments section. The
parameter .49 for \emph{government} in Model 1 marks the median of the
estimated posterior distribution. All else being equal, the aggregated
populism score is estimated to increase by .49 standard deviations when
a post mentions the government. The credible interval (CI) indicates
that 95\% of the posterior draws for that parameter lie between 0.47 and
0.51. Figure 2 plots the posterior distributions of the variables in
Model 1, showing that \emph{government} has the strongest positive
effect. As its 95\% highest density interval (HDI), here identical with
the CI, excludes zero, the null hypothesis is rejected and H1 supported.
Similarly, in support of H2, mentioning \emph{experts} has a large
(.13), positive effect, with a CI excluding zero {[}.11--.15{]}.

RQ1 asked for the impact of \emph{moderating comments} on user-generated
populism. Model 1 shows that this relationship is negative (-.13,
{[}-.16 -- -.09{]}). Comments sections including comments from the media
outlet itself were less populist. Somewhat surprisingly, \emph{media
type tabloid} is negatively associated with populism (RQ2). Compared to
the reference category, \emph{quality media}, comments sections on
Facebook pages of tabloids received -.37 {[}-.55 -- -.17{]} less
populist comments. Public broadcasters did not receive significantly
more populist comments than the quality press, as the CI {[}-.09--.29{]}
includes zero.

The COVID-19 specific predictors in Model 1 show that posts mentioning
\emph{COVID-19} were associated with .17 {[}.15 -- .19{]} higher levels
of populism in comments than other posts. This was the second-largest
positive effect in the model, as shown in Figure 1. Posts explicitly
mentioning \emph{restrictions}, a sub-category of COVID-19 posts, were
associated with .06 {[}.04--.09{]} more populist comments. These
findings support H3 and H4.

The effects of time were in accordance with expectations (H6 and H7).
With each \emph{day since the outbreak}, the level of populism in
comments increased by .02 {[}.00--.04{]}. The negative effect of the
predictor \emph{first wave} was pronounced, indicating that comments
sections below posts published during the first wave of COVID-19 were
.17 {[}-.20 -- -.14{]} SD less populist than comments sections of later
posts.

The main effect of \emph{stringency} in COVID-19 policies was positive
but very small (.03). Its credible interval {[}.02-.04{]} in Model 1
excludes zero but barely so. In Model 2 and Model 3, the CI includes
zero. These models explore the conditions under which stringency had a
positive impact more closely.

\caption{Highest-Density-Intervals (HDI) of Predictors in Model 1}

\end{figure}

Before moving on, the random effects of Model 1 should be noted. The
within-group variance (sig\textsuperscript{2}=.84) is large, while the
between-group variance for pages is small (tau\textsubscript{00}=.03),
and zero for countries, which is also reflected in the small intra-class
correlation coefficient (ICC) of .04. Zero variance between countries is
unsurprising, as the dependent variable was centered on country mean.
Fitting random intercepts for the level country would not have been
necessary. I kept this grouping variable, as Model 3 introduces random
slopes on this level.

Model 2 functions as intermediate step and adds the interaction term
\emph{COVID-19*Stringency.} To reduce model complexity, the
insignificant control variables \emph{fan count, incidence}, and
\emph{download age} were dropped, as well as the variable
\emph{restrictions,} which is not independent of \emph{COVID-19}. The
positive and significant coefficient for the interaction term
\emph{COVID-19*Stringency} suggests an interplay between mentioning
COVID-19 and the restrictiveness of policies, as expected in H5.
However, the main effect of stringency diminished.

To explore this pattern from a comparative perspective across countries,
and to answer RQ3, Model 3 estimates random slopes (i.e., varying
effects) for \emph{COVID-19, stringency,} and their interaction
\emph{COVID-19*Stringency} by \emph{country}. The random slopes variance
(tau\textsubscript{11}=.01) of Model 3 is larger than zero. While the CI
of both \emph{stringency} and the term \emph{COVID-19*Stringency} now
include zero, a substantive effect of stringency can be found for
specific countries. Figure 3 plots the distribution of the posterior
predictions of populism on the y-axis, conditional on the level of
stringency (x-axis and color) for each country. For this prediction,
mentioning \emph{COVID-19} was set to ``true,'' \emph{media type} was
set to ``quality'' and all other variables were held at mean,
respectively zero. Uncertainty from the page level was accounted for.

Figure 3 visualizes three things: The colored half-eye plots show the
distribution of the predicted level of populism when stringency is at
its minimum (yellow) and its maximum (purple) per country. The black dot
marks the median, the thick bar the 80\% CI, and the thin bar the 89\%
CI of this distribution. The layering thin lines illustrate the
estimated relationship on 300 draws.

The plot shows that \emph{stringency} had a positive effect in Austria,
Germany, and the Netherlands, when \emph{COVID-19} was mentioned. For
these countries, the thick 80\% CI bars for the stringency at minimum
and at maximum conditions do not overlap; the draws illustrate the
positive estimated relationship. However, for Austria and Netherlands,
this relationship is only credible when accepting an 80\% CI. For
Germany, this finding also holds on a 95\% CI. In the other countries,
the relationship is diffuse, insignificant, and even slightly reversed.
This illustrates why the effect is cancelled out on the population
level. This pattern also emerges when fitting separate models per
country (Appendix E). Overall, the evidence for H5 is mixed. Of the
control variables, only \emph{comments count} had a significant positive
effect on the level of populism. The Bayes-R\textsuperscript{2}
indicates that the models explain 16.2-16.8\% of the variance.

\subsection{Discussion and
Conclusions}\label{discussion-and-conclusions}}

This study analyzed how the COVID-19 crisis and media-related factors
shaped the levels of populism in user comments on news media Facebook
pages in seven European countries. It revealed several noteworthy
findings. First, Facebook posts mentioning \emph{COVID-19} and
\emph{restrictive containment policies} were associated with higher
levels of populism in comments, compared to other posts. These findings
provide circumstantial evidence for the argument that media coverage on
COVID-19 motivated some users to express populist ideas by triggering
reactance and activating populist attitudes. COVID-19 was an issue that
mobilized populist protests not only on the streets (Brubaker 2021) but
also online. Populism in comments also increased considerably after the
first wave of COVID-19, adding behavioral evidence to the finding of a
``pandemic fatigue'' which has fueled populist attitudes over time
(Jørgensen et al. 2022). The findings largely confirm previous findings
for Germany and Austria (Thiele 2022a) and align with psychological
research showing that novel messages spark less reactance (Rosenberg and
Siegel 2018).

Second, this study found that the \emph{stringency} of COVID-19 policies
had a varying impact on populism in comments across countries. At the
population level, the effect was mainly cancelled out by diverging
effects across countries. A comparative analysis found a limited
positive effect of containment policy stringency for Austria, Germany,
and the Netherlands. In these countries, stricter COVID-19 containment
policies were echoed by more populism in comments, when the post
mentioned COVID-19. The question is why this relationship was not
observed in all countries. In Sweden, the laissez-faire containment
policies may have prevented populist discontent (Gordon, Grafton, and
Steinshamn 2021). In Italy, the shock of the devastating first wave
might have increased acceptance of stringent policies. Finding ad-hoc
explanations for France and the United Kingdom is difficult. Future
research should investigate these differences by taking governmental
communication strategies and strategies of grassroots mobilization
(Neumayer, Pfaff, and Plümper 2023) into account.

Third, mentioning elite representatives was found to have triggered
populism. Mentioning the government had the strongest effect on populism
in comments, replicating a previous finding (Thiele 2022a). Different
from my previous findings (Thiele 2022a), posts mentioning experts were
here found to be associated with more populism. These different findings
can be driven by differences in the sample as well as by different
operationalizations. This finding also shows that science-related
populism (Mede and Schäfer 2020) is an important aspect of
user-generated populism. Overall, the study shows that the level of
populism in comments is highly responsive to the content and context of
posts. This finding contributes to the plausibility of the argument that
populist comments are expressions of populist attitudes (Blassnig,
Engesser, et al. 2019), that are activated by message characteristics
(Krämer 2014) and context (Hawkins, Rovira Kaltwasser, and Andreadis
2020). Additional research is needed, however, to investigate the
presumed mechanisms directly.

Fourth, my findings did not corroborate the existence of a
``complicity'' between the tabloid press and populism (Mazzoleni 2008,
50) on the level of user comments. Tabloid outlets received the lowest
levels of populism in comments. However, this does not necessarily imply
that readers of tabloids are less populist (Schulz 2019). Populist users
may deliberately visit the pages of quality press and public service
broadcasters to express discontent because they regard these to be part
of the establishment (Engesser et al. 2017). Fifth, this study found
that comments authored by the media page itself lowered the levels of
populism. This finding is indirect support for the effectiveness of
visible moderation (Gibson 2019).

This study has implications beyond the context of COVID-19. Contributing
to a more comprehensive understanding of citizen-generated populist
communication, the study identified factors influencing populism in
comments that may hold in other contexts---mentioning elites,
moderation, and media type. Moreover, the lessons learned during
COVID-19 can be projected onto other contexts concerning science-related
populism (Mede and Schäfer 2020). The debates surrounding climate change
resemble the COVID-19 crisis in crucial aspects: Climate change
communication tries to convince people to comply with restrictive
policies that are necessary to avert a global threat (Nabi, Gustafson,
and Jensen 2018). This aim is similarly challenged by citizens'
reactance (Ma, Dixon, and Hmielowski 2019) and populist online behavior
(Yan, Schroeder, and Stier 2022). Drawing on the findings here, one
could expect that climate change coverage similarly attracts populist
comments. Building on the country-specific relation between policy
stringency and populism found here, policymakers could be cautiously
optimistic that governance can shape the level of populist discontent
expressed online. More research is needed, however, to substantiate
these claims and investigate the role of governmental communication more
thoroughly. Finally, newsrooms worried about the harmful effects of
populist user comments can feel encouraged that visibly moderating their
comments sections can have a beneficial impact.

Methodologically, this study contributed to the field of computational
communication science by demonstrating the usefulness of the DDR
technique (Garten et al. 2018) for capturing ideological content. The
strengths of this method are that it provides a theory-driven, and
interpretable measurement (Garten et al. 2018, 351), as the core of the
measured concept can be gleaned from keywords. At the same time, it is
more flexible than conventional dictionaries by leveraging the potential
of word embeddings. The advantage of word embeddings over transformers
and large language models is that training on a custom corpus can be
performed on a local machine and is computationally relatively
inexpensive. This study has also contributed to the growing field of
multilingual computational text analysis (Licht and Lind 2023) by
demonstrating the usefulness -- and limitations -- of a full-text
machine translation approach. Future research can build on these
experiences.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

This study has limitations. First, validating the populism score
revealed imperfect measurement equivalence and potential measurement
error differential to language. Such error can cause bias in regressions
(TeBlunthuis, Hase, and Chan 2023) and is of particular concern for the
cross-country comparison. TeBlunthuis et al. (2023) recently introduced
a correction for misclassification error in regression analyses. Here,
implementing this correction was not possible as the manually annotated
data only provides a binary indicator of populism, not its ``true''
continuous value. The problem was approached here by centering the
populism score on the country mean, assuming that focusing on
within-country variance improves comparability. As this builds on strong
assumptions, the results of the country comparison must be taken with a
grain of salt. Another problem is that measurement error inflicted by
translation could not be discerned from error induced by
country-specific discourse. Future computational text analyses should
annotate validation data on the same scale as the automated measurement
to enable error correction. Continuous measurements could be validated
against aggregated scores of multiple annotators, to circumvent the
challenge of producing reliable continuous annotations (Grimmer and
Stewart 2013, 275). Second, machine translation is one strategy for
aligning the input of multilingual computational text analyses (Licht
and Lind 2023) that is not free of problems. In addition to the
imperfect measurement equivalence observed discussed above, commercial
translation APIs pose challenges for replicating findings, as they
change, are non-transparent, and are expensive. Local implementations or
multilingual embeddings are alternatives that should be considered.
Finally, this study did not test individual-level mechanisms directly,
as the anonymized digital trace data does not provide observations on
this level. Future research is encouraged to test the claims of this
study using experimental research designs.
