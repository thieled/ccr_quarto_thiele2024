  Citizen-generated populism is flourishing in the comments sections of online news. The factors that shape the extent of such populist communication from below are still under-researched. This study focuses on the COVID-19 crisis to examine how contextual and media-related factors are related to the extent of populism in comment sections on Facebook pages of news outlets from seven European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, SE and UK). Computational text analysis, machine translation and Bayesian multilevel regression were used to analyze digital trace data from 65,258 posts and 3.4 million comments published between February 2020 and June 2021. The computational measurements - multilingual dictionaries for posts and distributed dictionary representation to capture populism in comments - were rigorously validated. The results show that posts referring to the government, experts, COVID-19, and restrictions exhibit higher levels of populism in the comments sections. The stringency of containment policies was positively associated with populism in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands when COVID-19 was mentioned. Lower levels of populism were observed for tabloid media and when news outlets engaged in visible moderation. The implications of these findings beyond the pandemic context and methodological challenges are discussed.

## Introduction

Populist messages travel well on social media [@ernst2019PopulistsPrefer; @gerbaudo2018SocialMedia]. Politicians employ populist communication to stimulate user interactions [@jost2020PopulismFuels]. The participatory logic of social media also allows ordinary citizens to express their populist views [@devreese2018PopulismExpression]. Comments sections below news are bursting with citizen-generated populism, whether on websites [@blassnig2019HittingNerve] or on Facebook pages operated by news media [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. In parallel to a growing interest in populist attitudes [@marcos-marne2023WhatWe], researchers have begun to investigate populism in user comments [e.g., @blassnig2019HittingNerve; @galpin2019ParticipatoryPopulism]. These studies have focused on election periods [@blassnig2019HittingNerve; @galpin2019ParticipatoryPopulism] or relied on narrow country selections [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. What is lacking are cross-national studies that provide a comprehensive understanding of how "populism in reader comments is influenced by characteristics of the article or other context factors" [@blassnig2019PopulismOnline, p. 1124]. This study narrows this research gap by examining populism in user comments (henceforth "comments") on news media Facebook pages from seven European countries -- Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom -- in the context of COVID-19.

COVID-19 provides a unique opportunity for studying contextual influences on citizen-generated populism. Government containment policies drastically restricted personal freedoms, triggering psychological reactance in some citizens [@dillard2023PersuasiveMessages]. In many European countries, containment policies were met with protests [@kriesi2023ProtestUnlikely; @neumayer2023ProtestCovid19] that resonated with populist ideology [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism; @stecula2021HowPopulism]. Expressing discontent online became increasingly important during lockdowns [@kriesi2023ProtestUnlikely]. Online, COVID-19 was accompanied by an "infodemic", which is particularly well researched with regard to the spread of conspiracy theories [@righetti2022OnsetInfodemic]. Less is known about the crisis's impact on the proliferation of populist content in comments sections, which is unfortunate as comments can, for instance, influence other readers' attitudes toward vaccinations [@sun2023HowMisinformation]. Previously, I found that populist comments in Germany and Austria are linked to media coverage of COVID-19 [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. The limited country selection of that study prevented an adequate investigation of the impact of containment policies and additional media-related factors. Addressing these shortcomings, the present study aims to answer the following research question: How did the COVID-19 crisis and media-related factors influence populism in user comments on news media Facebook pages in seven Western European countries?

Here, seven hypotheses and three research questions are examined using digital trace data. This data source warrants high external validity [@blassnig2019HittingNerve, p. 630] but does not allow the direct testing of psychological mechanisms. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the contextual correlates of populism in user comments. A total of 65,258 posts and 3.4 million comments posted during the first three waves of COVID-19 (February 2020 -- June 2021) on 21 news media Facebook pages from seven European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, SE, UK) was analyzed. Comments were machine-translated [@vries2018NoLonger] into German. To measure populism, a computational text analysis technique called "distributed dictionary representation" [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions] was implemented [@thiele2022ThieledDictvectoR], applied, and validated. Post characteristics were captured using validated multilingual dictionaries. Real-world data were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker (OxCGRT) [@hale2020OxfordCOVID19]. Hypotheses were tested using Bayesian multilevel linear regression models [@burkner2022BrmsBayesian].

The results show that Facebook posts mentioning the government, experts, COVID-19, and restrictions were associated with higher levels of populism in comments. The stringency of COVID-19 policies affected populism differently in the analyzed countries. I found a limited, positive association in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands when posts mentioned COVID-19. Moderating comments by the media and, surprisingly, the media-type tabloid press were associated with lower levels of populism. The study concludes by discussing the implications of the findings beyond the pandemic and methodological limitations.

## Theory

### Populism in User Comments

Social media has changed the logic of political communication, integrating ordinary citizens into producing and distributing the news [@klinger2015EmergenceNetwork]. Most news media outlets operate pages on social media, where they share links to articles on their websites. Facebook remains the most widely used social media platform for news consumption in all countries studied here, although its heyday has passed [@newman2022ReutersInstitute]. On Facebook, users can comment under posts to express their opinions and engage in discussions and deliberation [@dahlberg2011ReconstructingDigital] or for less constructive purposes [@quandt2018DarkParticipation]. Negative aspects, such as high levels of incivility, often prevail in these spaces [@coe2014OnlineUncivil]. Populist content is one of those negative aspects [@waisbord2018WhyPopulism] and can have detrimental implications for the quality of the user discussion [@thiele2022HowRightWing].

Following Mudde [-@mudde2004PopulistZeitgeist, p. 543], populism is a thin-centered ideology which holds that 'the people' are ruled by a 'corrupt elite' and which demands unrestricted popular sovereignty. Populists imagine the people as a "homogenous and virtuous community" [@hawkins2018IntroductionIdeational, p. 3] that is only divided and deprived of its sovereignty at the instigation of a treacherous elite [@mudde2004PopulistZeitgeist]. The concept entails at least two dimensions: *anti-elitism* and *people-centrism* [@rooduijn2019StateField]. Popular sovereignty, which is sometimes considered a third dimension, is here considered as the point of contention between the people and the elite [@aslanidis2018MeasuringPopulist, p. 1255]. Following a communication-centered approach, I focus on expressions of populist ideas in text [@devreese2018PopulismExpression]. Online, populist ideology is often communicated in fragments [@engesser2017PopulismSocial]. Messages can be therefore more or less populist on a continuous scale [@aslanidis2018MeasuringPopulist]. Different actors can disseminate populist messages. Populism from politicians [@ernst2019PopulistsPrefer] and journalists [@wettstein2019WhatDrives] has received most scholarly attention. Although populism revolves around the idea of making the people's voice heard [@canovan1999TrustPeople], only a handful of studies have focused on populist content disseminated by ordinary citizens [@blassnig2019HittingNerve; @blassnig2019PopulismOnline; @galpin2019ParticipatoryPopulism; @thiele2022PandemicPopulism; @thiele2022HowRightWing]. These studies have mostly analyzed comments on news websites [@blassnig2019HittingNerve; @galpin2019ParticipatoryPopulism]. Here, I focus on comments below news media posts on Facebook, which is a preferred social media platform among populists [@schulz2019WherePopulist]. Facebook comments also exhibit a particularly low deliberative quality [@esau2017DesignMatters].

To explain the occurrence of populist comments, Blassnig et al. [-@blassnig2019HittingNerve, p. 634] have suggested to consider them as expressions of populist attitudes. Following Hawkins et al. [-@hawkins2020ActivationPopulist], populist attitudes require activation through the political context. Kr√§mer [-@kramer2014MediaPopulism, p. 55] argued that messages, such as media coverage, can activate a cognitive "populism schema" through priming. Hameleers et al. [-@hameleers2021EffectsPopulist] showed that fragments of populist communication can activate larger clusters of populist attitudes. Here, I argue that mentioning representatives of the elite in media posts works as an activating cue that eventually triggers populist comments. The elite is the key antagonist for populists [@hameleers2021EffectsPopulist]. Governments and experts are frequent targets of populist rhetoric [@jagers2007PopulismPolitical; @mede2020SciencerelatedPopulism] and were omnipresent in media coverage as managers of the COVID-19 crisis [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism]. Mentioning these groups may activate populist attitudes and motivate populist citizens to express these views, possibly by an emotional mechanism [@rico2017EmotionalUnderpinnings]. Previous findings support this argument [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. Therefore, I hypothesize the following:

**H1:** Facebook posts from news media mentioning the government are associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

**H2:** Facebook posts from news media mentioning experts are associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

Second, newsrooms' practices in moderating comments might affect opinion expression [@gibson2019FreeSpeech]. Some moderation practices are visible to other users, for example, when news media pages comment below their own posts to remind users about conversational rules [@wintterlin2020HowCope]. Populist users, known for breaching such norms [@hameleers2019PopulismOnline], may react to such moderation by turning silent, as they sense a hostile opinion climate [@matthes2018SpiralSilence]. Conversely, moderation might also backfire if it is perceived as censorship [@sherrick2018EffectExplicit]. Against this backdrop, I pose the following open research question regarding comments authored by the news media pages themselves:

**RQ1:** How are comments from news media moderating discussions on Facebook associated with the level of populism in comments sections?

Third, the level of populism in comments sections may vary across the type of news media operating the Facebook page. Theorists have often claimed complicity between the tabloid press and populism [@kramer2014MediaPopulism; @mazzoleni2008PopulismMedia], but content analyses have struggled to corroborate this claim [e.g., @bos2014PopulistRhetoric]. Readers of tabloid newspapers, however, support populist attitudes more strongly than audiences of public television or quality press [@schulz2019WherePopulist]. The implications of these findings for populism in comments remain unclear. Hence, I pose a second open research question:

**RQ2:** How is the type of news media operating a Facebook page associated with the level of populism in comments sections?

### The Pandemic and Populism

One main objective of this study is to examine how the context of COVID-19 has affected populism in comments. COVID-19 yielded a range of political consequences. While the first wave saw increased support for governments [@schraff2021PoliticalTrust], later stages were characterized by growing polarization and protests against containment policies [@kriesi2023ProtestUnlikely; @neumayer2023ProtestCovid19]. Scholars have linked those protests to populist ideology [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism; @flew2021GlobalTrust; @stecula2021HowPopulism]. Both, protesters against COVID-19 containment policies and populists exhibit a fundamental distrust in elites, an appetite for conspiracy theories, and a preference for commonsensical over expert knowledge [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism; @stecula2021HowPopulism]. Populist parties in Europe did not respond uniformly to the outbreak of the pandemic [@wondreys2022VictimsPandemic] but tried to later capitalize on the protests. Previous research has explained these protest events by strategic considerations of the organizers [@neumayer2023ProtestCovid19]. This explanation is convincing for offline events but offers little to explain expressions of discontent online, where little collective organization is required. The argument proposed here instead draws on a psychological mechanism.

*Psychological reactance* [@brehm1966TheoryPsychological; @brehm1981PsychologicalReactance] provides a conceptual framework to link the COVID-19 crisis and expressions of populism*.* Reactance "is the motivational state that is hypothesized to occur when a freedom is eliminated or threatened" [@brehm1981PsychologicalReactance, p. 37]. It involves anger and negative cognitions motivating people to restore the threatened freedom or, if this option is blocked, to engage in aggressive or compensatory behavior [@dillard2005NatureReactance; @rosenberg201850YearReview]. Cumulative evidence shows that the severity of a restriction tends to increase reactance [@rosenberg201850YearReview, 3]. While individuals react differently to experiencing reactance, commonly observed responses are expressing hostility toward, and derogating the source of, the restriction [@rosenberg201850YearReview, 3]. COVID-19 containment policies triggered such reactance reactions in some individuals [@dillard2023PersuasiveMessages].

I argue that experiencing reactance can activate populist attitudes [@hawkins2020ActivationPopulist] because of the anger involved in it [@dillard2005NatureReactance]. Anger has been linked to the support of populist ideas [@rico2017EmotionalUnderpinnings], and experiencing reactance during COVID-19 is associated with anti-government attitudes [@hajek2021ParadoxesReactance]. Moreover, populist expressions by opponents of containment policies reflect what reactance researchers call derogating the source of the restriction [@rosenberg201850YearReview]. For example, the government, scientists, and the media are denounced for having fabricated the crisis to impose a dictatorship [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism]. While examining individual motivations for such statements is beyond the scope of this study, the theoretical framework sketched here is useful for deriving hypotheses regarding the impact of contextual [@hawkins2020ActivationPopulist] and content-based [@kramer2014MediaPopulism] factors on populism in comments.

First, reactance occurs more frequently when people believe they are being targeted by persuasion [@rosenberg201850YearReview]. Media coverage of COVID-19 arguably included fear appeals [@sun2023HowMisinformation; @thiele2022PandemicPopulism] that is "persuasive messages designed to scare people by describing the terrible things that will happen to them if they do not do what the message recommends" [@witte1992PuttingFear, p. 329]. Opponents of COVID-19 policies often suspect COVID-19 coverage to be propaganda [@flew2021GlobalTrust]. Those citizens believe themselves to be targeted by a persuasion campaign. Such beliefs should spark reactance and could motivate citizens to express their anger in comments. Previous findings linked COVID-19 coverage in Germany and Austria to populist comments [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. News posts that explicitly mention restrictive COVID-19 policies may provoke even stronger reactions, as they prime freedom-threatening aspects. Following these considerations, I hypothesize the following:

**H3**: Facebook posts from news media mentioning COVID-19 are associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

**H4**: Facebook posts from news media mentioning restrictive COVID-19 containment policies are associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

Second, the magnitude of the threat to personal freedoms has been repeatedly found to be positively related to the level of reactance [@organ1974SocialExchange; @rosenberg201850YearReview]. In the context of COVID-19, the magnitude of restrictions can be determined as the "stringency" of COVID-19 containment policies, which included lockdowns, closing public venues, travel restrictions, or obligations to wear masks. To be clear, stringency denotes the severity of COVID-19 containment policies varying by day and country [@hale2020OxfordCOVID19], *not* the logical consistency of policies. Additionally, I expect that the stringency of COVID-19 policies affects populism in comments sections only if the news post mentions the topic of COVID-19. Therefore, I hypothesize:

**H5**: For Facebook posts from news media mentioning COVID-19, the stringency of COVID-19 containment policies is associated with increased levels of populism in the comments section.

Third, the *stringency* of containment policies varied considerably in the countries studied here [@gordon2021CrosscountryEffects]. Italy, for example, was hit early and hard by the pandemic and imposed tough restrictions, while Sweden followed a laissez-faire approach. The restrictions in Germany and France were comparable but the protests differed widely [@kriesi2023ProtestUnlikely]. How these patterns translate to populist expressions online remains unclear. Hence, I pose the explorative research question:

**RQ3:** How does the association between stringency of COVID-19 containment policies and the level of populism in comments sections vary by country?

Finally, drawing on previous findings [@jorgensen2022PandemicFatigue, p. 1], I expect that a "pandemic fatigue" increased levels of political discontent and expressions of populist attitudes over time. One reason could be that repeating persuasive messages can increase reactance [@koch2013HelpfulHarmful]. Similarly, message novelty has been linked to less reactance [@rosenberg201850YearReview]. The former implies an effect that gradually increases over time, while the latter suggests considerably lower levels of populism during the first wave of COVID-19. Similar associations were observed previously [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. As a result, I hypothesize the following:

**H6**: Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the level of populism in comments sections increased.

**H7**: During the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, the level of populism in comments sections was lower, compared to later stages.

## Data and Methods

### Data

This study analyzes digital trace data, downloaded via Facebook API using Facepager [@junger2020FacepagerApplication] and R. These data warrant high external validity, as they trace behavior that is likely to be suppressed in experiments due to social desirability [@blassnig2019HittingNerve, p. 630]. Anonymization through the API, however, limits individual-level analysis. Hence, this study analyzes the correlates of populism in comments but cannot test psychological or causal mechanisms directly.

The country selection aimed at maximizing variance in the stringency of containment policies and the scope of protests [@neumayer2023ProtestCovid19]. Seven European countries were selected: Austria (AT), Germany (DE), France (FR), Italy (IT), Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), and United Kingdom (UK). These countries varied considerably regarding the stringency of COVID-19 containment policies and the level of protests against them [@neumayer2023ProtestCovid19].

These countries also represent different (legacy) media systems [@hallin2004ComparingMedia]. What all seven countries have in common is that they are liberal, Western European democracies that have a record of successful mobilization by populist parties, mostly from the right [@mudde2007PopulistRadical]. Per country, I selected one news media outlet for each of the three media types quality press, tabloid press, and public broadcaster, based on the weekly reach of the corresponding news website [@newman2022ReutersInstitute]. For each outlet, I identified the corresponding Facebook page. Data were only collected from Facebook. Table 1 reports the selected outlets by country and media type, along with the number of Facebook followers, and the number of posts considered in the analysis.

From each Facebook page, all accessible posts published in the first three waves of COVID-19 (1 February 2020 -- 30 June 2021) were downloaded. For each of the n=65,258 posts, the first 100 comments were downloaded, resulting in a dataset of n=3,424,691 comments. Capping the number of comments aimed to limit the number of API calls, as the access is shared with all Facepager users [@junger2020FacepagerApplication]. The cap is ten times larger than in previous studies [@blassnig2019HittingNerve, p. 636], and higher than the median number of comments per post (n=58).

### Validation Data

For validation, 2,040 posts and 2,040 comments were randomly sampled with equal distribution across countries for annotation by six native-speaking, trained coders (five students and the author); 150 units each were machine-translated for parallel coding. Reliability is reported as Krippendorff's alpha. Occurrences of *anti-elitism* (alpha=.80) and *people-centrism* (.73) were coded binarily in comments. Considering the fragmentary nature of populist online communication [@engesser2017PopulismSocial], a comment was considered populist if either people-centrism or anti-elitism was coded. Posts were coded for references to *COVID-19* (.96), *restrictive containment policies* (.75), the *government* (.78), and scientific *experts* (.76). The instructions align with Blassnig, Engesser, et al. [-@blassnig2019HittingNerve; see also @blassnig2016CodebookPopulist] and a previously used codebook [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism] and are documented in Appendix A.

### Multilingual Data

Computational analyses of multilingual texts face the challenge of ensuring measurement equivalence and context-sensitivity across countries, while maintaining cost-efficiency [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual]. Formal criteria for the first two aspects have yet to be established [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual]. Here, several strategies were used to approach these goals. Relying on native speakers to annotate the validation data was a first step. The further procedure differed for posts and comments.

Multilingual dictionaries were used to capture topics and actors mentioned in posts. Dictionaries count the occurrence of keywords. Pretests suggested that high levels of recall*,* indicating performance in capturing all relevant documents, and precision, indicating performance in capturing only relevant documents, could be achieved by translating an existing German dictionary [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. This was the most cost-effective solution. The dictionary was translated using in-context translation websites (context.reverso.net; linguee.de). The country-specific dictionaries were expanded by nearest neighbors from word embeddings (*fastText*) [@bojanowski2017EnrichingWord], trained on post data. Word embeddings represent semantic relations of words in a vector space and result from machine learning algorithms, trained on large corpora [e.g., @bojanowski2017EnrichingWord]. With the help of the mentioned translation websites, I identified and removed terms that tapped into unintended contexts. Validation is reported in the section on explanatory variables.

For capturing populism in comments, translating an existing German dictionary [@grundl2022PopulistIdeas] was deemed not feasible, as it contains 13k regular expressions. To find a "common denominator" for comparison, comments were machine-translated [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual, p. 9]. Following findings of Vries et al. [-@vries2018NoLonger], I opted for the Google Translate API. German was chosen as the lingua franca, as this limited the costs most efficiently and matched my expertise in capturing populism in German text [@thiele2022HowRightWing]. For economic reasons, comments were truncated to 540 characters before translation, which affected 1.8% of all comments.

Two further measures aimed at facilitating context-sensitivity and equivalence. First, the translated corpus was used to train a custom word embedding model, which underpins the populism measurement described below. This model thus provides a common reference point, but also accounts for country-specific uses of words that may persist even after translation [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual, p. 23]. Second, during optimization, I selected the measurement that most coherently maximized the output-validity score across countries. Despite these precautions, the achieved level of equivalence is not perfect, as discussed in the next and the concluding section.

### Dependent Variable

Populism in comments was measured using the computational text analysis technique "distributed dictionary representation" (DDR) [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions]. DDR combines dictionaries with word embeddings to measure how strongly a concept is represented in a text [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions]. Conventional dictionary approaches suffer from low recall [@rauh2018ValidatingSentiment]. DDR is similarly theory-driven as a dictionary, since it captures a concept by researcher-defined keywords. However, it circumvents the need to provide exhaustive lists of words by leveraging word embeddings. The conceptual dictionary and each document are represented as average vectors of the embeddings that represent the meaning of each word in them. DDR then computes the cosine similarity between these vectors, which can range from -1 to +1. This provides a crude indicator for how strongly the concept is reflected in each document [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions]. This technique works best with short, clear-cut dictionaries [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions, p. 348]. The *dictvectoR* [@thiele2022ThieledDictvectoR] R-package implements DDR using *fastText* word embeddings, which are tailored to social media texts, and account for misspellings, out-of-vocabulary words, and morphological rich languages, like German [@bojanowski2017EnrichingWord]. A custom *fastText* model was trained on the translated and originally German corpus of comments, and all German-speaking posts. The model has 200 dimensions and a vocabulary of 89k words.

The populism measurement was optimized using 70% of the annotated comments, keeping 30% as test sample. For evaluation, DDR scores were transformed into binary predictors using logistic regression and compared to the annotation. This is not a gold standard test but circumvents the problem of producing granular manual annotations reliably [@grimmer2013TextData, p. 275]. Evaluation focused on F1, a harmonic mean of recall and precision. The optimization aimed to arrive at a short, expressive dictionary that is *inductive* (i.e. reflects the content of observed comments), *theory-driven* (i.e. covers key dimensions of populism), and *comparable* (i.e. maximizes F1 consistently across all countries). The process, documented in Appendix C, followed the following steps: (a) identifying words from the *fastText* model's vocabulary that semantically resemble the corpus annotated as populist; (b) adding multiword-expressions; (c) manually selecting words on theoretical grounds; (d) generating 2.9 million keyword combinations of different lengths from these words; and (e) evaluating these dictionaries across countries.

The dictionary that maximized F1 best across all countries is presented in Table 1, along with translation and performance scores for the test and train data. This dictionary was deemed theoretically convincing as it features words that represent "the elite" from different areas of society (*"politics and media", "government", "nepotism",* *"so-called experts",* and *"state media"*), words that invoke "the people" as an in-group ("*people", "taxpayers", "our system",* and *"our tax money"*), and words that characterize the struggle over sovereignty between these antagonists ("*dictatorship", "muzzled",* and *"obfuscate"*). Although these words are not necessarily populist in isolation, their combined meaning cuts through a broad range of populist key messages [@blassnig2019HittingNerve, p. 638]. This short dictionary is sensitive to the context of COVID-19 but should be able to capture populism in other contexts as well.

The DDR measurement performs well overall (F1=.74) and is relatively consistent across countries. It outperforms Gr√ºndl's [-@grundl2022PopulistIdeas] dictionary, which reached a low F1 of .19. Against this backdrop, I consider this measurement a satisfactory proxy for populism. However, the output-validity scores vary across countries, with the lowest test-performance for the Netherlands (F1=.66), indicating a lack of equivalence and measurement error differential to language. I account for this by centering the populism scores on the country-level means. In the concluding section I discuss the limitations of this approach.

The DDR measure was applied to the dataset of translated comments. Titles of hyperlinks were used when comments contained no other text. Text cleaning is documented in Appendix B. I replaced n=19,047 missing values (0.6%) by the mean populism score per page and week to not lose observations. The comment-level scores were aggregated per post as mean, reflecting the manifestation of a collective populist voice [@galpin2019ParticipatoryPopulism], standardized, and centered to country-mean.

### Explanatory Variables

A German dictionary [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism] was translated and expanded for all countries to capture mentions of *COVID-19, restrictive policies*, the *government*, and *experts* in posts, as documented in the section on multilingualism. The case-sensitive government dictionaries were expanded by the names of the national government members, scraped from Wikipedia. Validity was tested against the full annotated sample of n=2,036 posts. Table 3 reports the results. Appendix D documents the dictionaries.

*Moderation* was operationalized as a binary variable, indicating if a post's comments section included a comment from the news media account operating the Facebook page, which was not anonymized by the API. *Media type* is indicated by a categorical variable.

For the *stringency* of COVID-19 policies, this study uses the index from the *Oxford COVID Response Tracker (OxCRT)* [@hale2020OxfordCOVID19], which is provided in country-day format. The index is composed of nine ordinal indicators and ranges from 0 to 100, indicating restrictive policies by larger values.

![COVID-19 Incidences and Policy Stringency Over Time by Country](plots/p_realw_20240226.pdf)

In Figure 1, the stringency level for each country throughout the observed time frame is plotted as a colored histogram and the 7-day incidence rate as a line. The red bars mark phases when containment policies were stricter than the overall median, the yellow bars indicate below-median phases. Expecting that policies affect comments with some delay, this study lagged the stringency variable by 14 days. The lag was chosen based on its somewhat stronger correlation with populism (.07), compared to other lags. Time was operationalized by a variable counting the days since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020, and by a dummy indicating if the post was published during the *first wave* of COVID-19.

### Control Variables

Controls include the 14-day lagged *incidence rate* (i.e., the weekly rolling number of new infections per 100.000 inhabitants in a country-day format, retrieved from the OxCRT). Additional controls are the number of *comments* per post, *download age* (i.e., days passed between post and download), and the logged number of Facebook *fans*. Table 4 presents the summary statistics. Continuous independent variables were standardized and centered on the population mean before being included in the models.

### Model Specifications

Linear regression was used for hypothesis testing, as the dependent variable is continuous. Accounting for the nested structure of the data, with posts nested in pages, and pages nested in countries, multilevel models were fitted [@gelman2007DataAnalysis]. The small number of country-level clusters and the non-randomness of the sample create problems for frequentist inference [@chan2023BayesianMultilevel].

Accounting for both, the models were fitted in a Bayesian framework, using the *brms* package [@burkner2022BrmsBayesian]. Media type could be considered an additional level but was included as a fixed effect, as it has only three categories. Model 1 accounts for random intercepts for countries and pages. Model 2 drops four variables to avoid over-parameterization and adds two interaction terms. Model 3 fits random slopes for COVID-19, stringency, and their interaction across all countries. The models were fitted using non-informative priors, and 3,000 iterations of three chains that converged.

## Results

Table 5 reports the results from the linear multilevel Bayesian regression models with the mean populism score per post as the dependent variable. H1 proposed that posts mentioning the *government* are associated with higher levels of populism in the comments section. The parameter .49 for *government* in Model 1 marks the median of the estimated posterior distribution. All else being equal, the aggregated populism score is estimated to increase by .49 standard deviations when a post mentions the government. The credible interval (CI) indicates that 95% of the posterior draws for that parameter lie between 0.47 and 0.51. Figure 2 plots the posterior distributions of the variables in Model 1, showing that *government* has the strongest positive effect. As its 95% highest density interval (HDI), here identical with the CI, excludes zero, the null hypothesis is rejected and H1 supported. Similarly, in support of H2, mentioning *experts* has a large (.13), positive effect, with a CI excluding zero \[.11--.15\].

RQ1 asked for the impact of *moderating comments* on user-generated populism. Model 1 shows that this relationship is negative (-.13, \[-.16 -- -.09\]). Comments sections including comments from the media outlet itself were less populist. Somewhat surprisingly, *media type tabloid* is negatively associated with populism (RQ2). Compared to the reference category, *quality media*, comments sections on Facebook pages of tabloids received -.37 \[-.55 -- -.17\] less populist comments. Public broadcasters did not receive significantly more populist comments than the quality press, as the CI \[-.09--.29\] includes zero.

The COVID-19 specific predictors in Model 1 show that posts mentioning *COVID-19* were associated with .17 \[.15 -- .19\] higher levels of populism in comments than other posts. This was the second-largest positive effect in the model, as shown in Figure 1. Posts explicitly mentioning *restrictions*, a sub-category of COVID-19 posts, were associated with .06 \[.04--.09\] more populist comments. These findings support H3 and H4.

The effects of time were in accordance with expectations (H6 and H7). With each *day since the outbreak*, the level of populism in comments increased by .02 \[.00--.04\]. The negative effect of the predictor *first wave* was pronounced, indicating that comments sections below posts published during the first wave of COVID-19 were .17 \[-.20 -- -.14\] SD less populist than comments sections of later posts.

The main effect of *stringency* in COVID-19 policies was positive but very small (.03). Its credible interval \[.02-.04\] in Model 1 excludes zero but barely so. In Model 2 and Model 3, the CI includes zero. These models explore the conditions under which stringency had a positive impact more closely.

![Highest-Density-Intervals (HDI) of Predictors in Model 1](plots/hdi_m3b_20240226.pdf)

Before moving on, the random effects of Model 1 should be noted. The within-group variance (sig^2^=.84) is large, while the between-group variance for pages is small (tau~00~=.03), and zero for countries, which is also reflected in the small intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of .04. Zero variance between countries is unsurprising, as the dependent variable was centered on country mean. Fitting random intercepts for the level country would not have been necessary. I kept this grouping variable, as Model 3 introduces random slopes on this level.

Model 2 functions as intermediate step and adds the interaction term *COVID-19\*Stringency.* To reduce model complexity, the insignificant control variables *fan count, incidence*, and *download age* were dropped, as well as the variable *restrictions,* which is not independent of *COVID-19*. The positive and significant coefficient for the interaction term *COVID-19\*Stringency* suggests an interplay between mentioning COVID-19 and the restrictiveness of policies, as expected in H5. However, the main effect of stringency diminished.

To explore this pattern from a comparative perspective across countries, and to answer RQ3, Model 3 estimates random slopes (i.e., varying effects) for *COVID-19, stringency,* and their interaction *COVID-19\*Stringency* by *country*. The random slopes variance (tau~11~=.01) of Model 3 is larger than zero. While the CI of both *stringency* and the term *COVID-19\*Stringency* now include zero, a substantive effect of stringency can be found for specific countries. Figure 3 plots the distribution of the posterior predictions of populism on the y-axis, conditional on the level of stringency (x-axis and color) for each country. For this prediction, mentioning *COVID-19* was set to "true," *media type* was set to "quality" and all other variables were held at mean, respectively zero. Uncertainty from the page level was accounted for.

Figure 3 visualizes three things: The colored half-eye plots show the distribution of the predicted level of populism when stringency is at its minimum (yellow) and its maximum (purple) per country. The black dot marks the median, the thick bar the 80% CI, and the thin bar the 89% CI of this distribution. The layering thin lines illustrate the estimated relationship on 300 draws.

The plot shows that *stringency* had a positive effect in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands, when *COVID-19* was mentioned. For these countries, the thick 80% CI bars for the stringency at minimum and at maximum conditions do not overlap; the draws illustrate the positive estimated relationship. However, for Austria and Netherlands, this relationship is only credible when accepting an 80% CI. For Germany, this finding also holds on a 95% CI. In the other countries, the relationship is diffuse, insignificant, and even slightly reversed. This illustrates why the effect is cancelled out on the population level. This pattern also emerges when fitting separate models per country (Appendix E). Overall, the evidence for H5 is mixed. Of the control variables, only *comments count* had a significant positive effect on the level of populism. The Bayes-R^2^ indicates that the models explain 16.2-16.8% of the variance.

## Discussion and Conclusions

This study analyzed how the COVID-19 crisis and media-related factors shaped the levels of populism in user comments on news media Facebook pages in seven European countries. It revealed several noteworthy findings. First, Facebook posts mentioning *COVID-19* and *restrictive containment policies* were associated with higher levels of populism in comments, compared to other posts. These findings provide circumstantial evidence for the argument that media coverage on COVID-19 motivated some users to express populist ideas by triggering reactance and activating populist attitudes. COVID-19 was an issue that mobilized populist protests not only on the streets [@brubaker2021ParadoxesPopulism] but also online. Populism in comments also increased considerably after the first wave of COVID-19, adding behavioral evidence to the finding of a "pandemic fatigue" which has fueled populist attitudes over time [@jorgensen2022PandemicFatigue]. The findings largely confirm previous findings for Germany and Austria [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism] and align with psychological research showing that novel messages spark less reactance [@rosenberg201850YearReview].

Second, this study found that the *stringency* of COVID-19 policies had a varying impact on populism in comments across countries. At the population level, the effect was mainly cancelled out by diverging effects across countries. A comparative analysis found a limited positive effect of containment policy stringency for Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. In these countries, stricter COVID-19 containment policies were echoed by more populism in comments, when the post mentioned COVID-19. The question is why this relationship was not observed in all countries. In Sweden, the laissez-faire containment policies may have prevented populist discontent [@gordon2021CrosscountryEffects]. In Italy, the shock of the devastating first wave might have increased acceptance of stringent policies. Finding ad-hoc explanations for France and the United Kingdom is difficult. Future research should investigate these differences by taking governmental communication strategies and strategies of grassroots mobilization [@neumayer2023ProtestCovid19] into account.

Third, mentioning elite representatives was found to have triggered populism. Mentioning the government had the strongest effect on populism in comments, replicating a previous finding [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism]. Different from my previous findings [@thiele2022PandemicPopulism], posts mentioning experts were here found to be associated with more populism. These different findings can be driven by differences in the sample as well as by different operationalizations. This finding also shows that science-related populism [@mede2020SciencerelatedPopulism] is an important aspect of user-generated populism. Overall, the study shows that the level of populism in comments is highly responsive to the content and context of posts. This finding contributes to the plausibility of the argument that populist comments are expressions of populist attitudes [@blassnig2019HittingNerve], that are activated by message characteristics [@kramer2014MediaPopulism] and context [@hawkins2020ActivationPopulist]. Additional research is needed, however, to investigate the presumed mechanisms directly.

Fourth, my findings did not corroborate the existence of a "complicity" between the tabloid press and populism [@mazzoleni2008PopulismMedia, p. 50] on the level of user comments. Tabloid outlets received the lowest levels of populism in comments. However, this does not necessarily imply that readers of tabloids are less populist [@schulz2019WherePopulist]. Populist users may deliberately visit the pages of quality press and public service broadcasters to express discontent because they regard these to be part of the establishment [@engesser2017PopulismSocial]. Fifth, this study found that comments authored by the media page itself lowered the levels of populism. This finding is indirect support for the effectiveness of visible moderation [@gibson2019FreeSpeech].

This study has implications beyond the context of COVID-19. Contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of citizen-generated populist communication, the study identified factors influencing populism in comments that may hold in other contexts---mentioning elites, moderation, and media type. Moreover, the lessons learned during COVID-19 can be projected onto other contexts concerning science-related populism [@mede2020SciencerelatedPopulism]. The debates surrounding climate change resemble the COVID-19 crisis in crucial aspects: Climate change communication tries to convince people to comply with restrictive policies that are necessary to avert a global threat [@nabi2018FramingClimate]. This aim is similarly challenged by citizens' reactance [@ma2019PsychologicalReactance] and populist online behavior [@yan2022ThereLink]. Drawing on the findings here, one could expect that climate change coverage similarly attracts populist comments. Building on the country-specific relation between policy stringency and populism found here, policymakers could be cautiously optimistic that governance can shape the level of populist discontent expressed online. More research is needed, however, to substantiate these claims and investigate the role of governmental communication more thoroughly. Finally, newsrooms worried about the harmful effects of populist user comments can feel encouraged that visibly moderating their comments sections can have a beneficial impact.

Methodologically, this study contributed to the field of computational communication science by demonstrating the usefulness of the DDR technique [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions] for capturing ideological content. The strengths of this method are that it provides a theory-driven, and interpretable measurement [@garten2018DictionariesDistributions, p. 351], as the core of the measured concept can be gleaned from keywords. At the same time, it is more flexible than conventional dictionaries by leveraging the potential of word embeddings. The advantage of word embeddings over transformers and large language models is that training on a custom corpus can be performed on a local machine and is computationally relatively inexpensive. This study has also contributed to the growing field of multilingual computational text analysis [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual] by demonstrating the usefulness -- and limitations -- of a full-text machine translation approach. Future research can build on these experiences.

## Limitations

This study has limitations. First, validating the populism score revealed imperfect measurement equivalence and potential measurement error differential to language. Such error can cause bias in regressions [@teblunthuis2023MisclassificationAutomated] and is of particular concern for the cross-country comparison. TeBlunthuis et al. [-@teblunthuis2023MisclassificationAutomated] recently introduced a correction for misclassification error in regression analyses. Here, implementing this correction was not possible as the manually annotated data only provides a binary indicator of populism, not its "true" continuous value. The problem was approached here by centering the populism score on the country mean, assuming that focusing on within-country variance improves comparability. As this builds on strong assumptions, the results of the country comparison must be taken with a grain of salt. Another problem is that measurement error inflicted by translation could not be discerned from error induced by country-specific discourse. Future computational text analyses should annotate validation data on the same scale as the automated measurement to enable error correction. Continuous measurements could be validated against aggregated scores of multiple annotators, to circumvent the challenge of producing reliable continuous annotations [@grimmer2013TextData, p. 275]. Second, machine translation is one strategy for aligning the input of multilingual computational text analyses [@licht2023GoingCrosslingual] that is not free of problems. In addition to the imperfect measurement equivalence observed discussed above, commercial translation APIs pose challenges for replicating findings, as they change, are non-transparent, and are expensive. Local implementations or multilingual embeddings are alternatives that should be considered. Finally, this study did not test individual-level mechanisms directly, as the anonymized digital trace data does not provide observations on this level. Future research is encouraged to test the claims of this study using experimental research designs.
